# Quiz 2 - Python Programming Command-Line Application
## Project Description

This repository contains basic Python programs demonstrating fundamental programming concepts required in Integrated Programming and Technologies. Each program is saved in a separate file, where the **filename corresponds to the title of the question**.

## File List and Description

1. **User_Input.py** – Accepts user input for name and age, then displays the formatted output.
2. **Conditional_Statement.py** – Determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.
3. **Looping.py** – Prints all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a loop.
4. **Functions_and_Data_Structures.py** – Defines and calls a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.
5. **List_Processing.py** – Accepts five numbers from the user, stores them in a list, sorts them from highest to lowest, and displays the result.

## How to Run the Programs

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the `.py` files.
4. Run a program using:

   ```
   python filename.py
   ```

   (Replace `filename.py` with the actual file name.)

## Notes

* These programs focus on basic Python syntax such as `print`, `input`, lists, loops, conditional statements, and functions.
* All outputs are displayed in the console.
